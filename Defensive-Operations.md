# Defensive Security (Blue Team)

## Key Areas

**Monitoring and Detecting**

- Continually observing network and system activity to detect suspicious behaviour and events.
- These may include, for example, monitoring for logins from another country while the employee is based in the company's London office.

**Incident Response**

- The team quickly comes together if suspicious activity is confirmed and alerts are raised.
- This is when the Incident Response process begins. The process involves containing and removing the threat and restoring the business back to normality.

**Threat Intelligence**

- Gathering and using information about attackers—their latest methods, targets, and trends—can greatly strengthen an organisation’s defences.
-  For example, understanding that an attacker focuses on a specific software application used within organisations.

**Vulnerability Management**

- Fixing software or system flaws is an important preventative measure that can lower the risk of an attack.
- Security teams can check which systems attackers are most likely to target. This can be done manually or with the help of automated tools.

**Investigation and Analysis**
- Members of a defensive security team are always monitoring and analysing what’s happening inside an organisation.
- They work to separate normal activity from suspicious behaviour, digging into the details like solving a puzzle to uncover valuable insights.

## Defensive Measures

Organisations don’t rely on a single tool or method to stay secure — they build layers of defence. It is called **"Defence in Depth"** meaning that if one security measure fails, there are others to rely upon at various stages.

**Employee Training**

- In today's world, the human factor of cyber security cannot be ignored.
- With attacks more often than not targeting employees rather than systems, training employees to be proactive in recognising attempts for things like phishing is essential.

**Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)**

- These devices act as surveillance cameras across the organisation's IT.
- They monitor and alert when suspicious behaviour or activity is detected across the network or systems.

**Firewalls**

- These devices act as security guards on an organisation's network.
- They monitor and determine what traffic is allowed to enter the network, or should be rejected.

**Security Policies**

- Security policies help organisations ensure that their systems are used correctly.
- They can reduce risk by blocking access to dangerous websites or requiring strong passwords, making it harder for attackers to guess login details.

## Security Operations Centre (SOC)

A SOC is a centralized organizational unit consisting of people, processes, and technology dedicated to continuously monitoring, detecting, and responding to cybersecurity incidents. It serves as a command center where security professionals analyze activity across networks and systems to mitigate threats, manage vulnerabilities, and ensure an organization’s defensive posture is maintained 24/7.

## Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)

SIEM is a comprehensive software solution that aggregates and analyzes log data and security events from diverse sources across an entire IT infrastructure, such as firewalls, servers, and IDS/IPS. By providing real-time visibility and using correlation rules to identify patterns of suspicious activity, the SIEM acts as the central analytical engine that enables security teams to detect complex threats and automate incident reporting.
