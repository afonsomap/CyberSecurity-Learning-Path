# Vulnerabilities & Exploits

## CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures)

CVE, which stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures, **is a publicly available list of standardized identifiers for cybersecurity vulnerabilities in software and hardware**. Think of it as a unique "ID card" for a specific security flaw, such as `CVE-2021-44228`. By assigning a unique ID to each vulnerability, the system allows security professionals, researchers, and vendors to *speak the same language*, ensuring that everyone is tracking and discussing the exact same threat across different security tools and databases.

Managed by the **MITRE Corporation** in collaboration with various CVE Numbering Authorities (CNAs)—such as Microsoft, Google, and Red Hat—the system provides a clear description and reference links for every recorded flaw. It is important to distinguish a CVE from its CVSS score; while the CVE identifies what the vulnerability is, the **CVSS provides a numerical score (0.0 to 10.0) to indicate how severe it is**. This standardized approach helps organizations worldwide prioritize their patching efforts and defend against cyberattacks more effectively.

## Exploit Database

An Exploit Database **is a public, searchable archive of "exploits"—the actual scripts, code, or proof-of-concept (PoC) tools used to take advantage of specific software vulnerabilities**. While a CVE acts as the theoretical "ID" for a bug, an exploit database provides the practical proof: **it shows exactly how to trigger that bug to gain access or crash a system**. It is an essential resource for penetration testers and security auditors who use these ready-made scripts to verify if a client’s network is truly vulnerable to a known threat.

The most famous repository, **Exploit-DB (maintained by Offensive Security)**, hosts a massive collection of shellcode and security papers alongside the exploits themselves. However, it is a classic double-edged sword; while it empowers "White Hat" hackers to secure systems by understanding the attacker's methods, it also provides "Black Hat" actors with a "cheat sheet" of functional code for intrusion. In short, if the CVE is the diagnosis of a disease, the Exploit Database is the set of instructions on how the virus actually behaves in the wild.
